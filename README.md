# pokedex

I wanted to make a very cool Pokedex but look at me procrastinating T_T.
Aight will completed it later. I gotta make it's UI better :') .  

Currently you can search any Pokemon in this and it will present you with it's 
stats and picture. It uses my PokeApi that I created with Flask ( look at the repo with same name).

Features (that I want to include):
1. Identify Pokemon by pointing camera toward picture or just by uploading it.
2. Poke Fights ( I mean comparing two pokemon and better stats win yay)
3. Only above two but three points look cool.
